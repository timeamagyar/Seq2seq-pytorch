238195002935762944	2012-08-22 08:44:48	richardclegg	@andrewducker Yes. I don't think there's a disagreement about that point of law.
238195217151438848	2012-08-22 08:45:39	andrewducker	@richardclegg So the level of argumentation is backed up by legal accuracy. I'm not seeing your problem here.
238195413532938240	2012-08-22 08:46:26	richardclegg	@andrewducker Claiming this gives insight into the likelihood from the various countries is specious in the extreme IMHO.
